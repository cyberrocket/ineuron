    "### 1. A spam filter is designed by looking at commonly occurring phrases in spam. Suppose that 80% of email is spam. In 10% of the spam emails, the phrase “free money” is used, whereas this phrase is only used in 1% of non-spam emails. A new email has just arrived, which does mention “free money”. What is the probability that it is spam?\n",
